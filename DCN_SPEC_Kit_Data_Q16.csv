"If yes, please specify the file size limit.",
Response,Count
100 MB per file,1
200MB,1
1 GB per item,1
2 GB,14
2GB per file,2
2 GB limit for dataset,1
"2Gb for browser-based uploads, no size limit on the backend",1
2GB per file for the self-deposit institutional repository with the option to upload more with assistance from library staff. ,1
2GB per file per Dataverse policy with option to request more,1
~5GB,1
50 GB maximum per file,1
500 MB through self-deposit; mediated deposit doesn't have an explicit limit although we aim to give each researcher 2 TB of space.,1
5GB unmediated; higher limits mediated,1
Dataverse - 2GB; university Library  - no limit,1
For self deposit we say 2G - in practice it is whatever,1
I believe DSpace has a 2 GB limit; we are discussing imposing more stringent limits as we explore expanding services.,1
"No specified limit from Digital Commons, but there is an unspecified practical limit imposed by the HTTP protocol used for file uploads",1
Self-deposit: 100 MB | system limit =~ 1TB,1
"There is no explicit file size limit; however, we encourage users to keep file sizes below 1-2G because files larger than this often get hung up when accessing using HTTP, which is how most users access files in our repository.",1
Variable,1
We meet with each researcher to determine the amount of data. Large data sets above 1TB need special consideration.,1
