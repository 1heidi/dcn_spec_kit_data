### DATASET DESCRIPTION 

SPEC surveys gather information from Association for Research Libraries (ARL) member institutions on current research library practices and policies (http://publications.arl.org/SPEC_Kits). SPEC survey topics are proposed by authors, primarily from ARL institutions, who create the survey instrument, which is then administered by ARL. Following close of the survey response window, the results are analyzed and synthesized into a final report, written by the authors and edited by the ARL Publications Program Officer. This SPEC Kit contains an executive summary of the survey results, survey questions and responses, examples of representative documents (such as policies, procedures, handbooks, guidelines, websites, job descriptions, brochures, and statements) to serve as a snapshot of the current state of the topic, and a bibliography of selected resources, including relevant literature and online information.

A SPEC survey on data curation was conducted in January of 2017. The purpose was to uncover the current infrastructure (policy and technical) at ARL member institutions for data curation, explore the current level of demand for data curation services, and discover any challenges that institutions are currently facing regarding providing these services. The survey instrument was developed by the creators listed here and administered by the ARL Publications Program Officer, Lee Anne George. 

Invitations to complete the survey were sent to the SPEC survey liaisons at the 124 ARL member libraries via email. Responses were collected using SurveyMonkey during a window from January 3, 2017 - January 30, 2017. A total of 80 libraries completed the survey, and numeric data were primarily analyzed and visualized using Microsoft Excel. This dataset contains data used to generate figures in the final publication for SPEC Kit 354: Data Curation (May 2017). Per participant consent, only aggregate data can be released. Additional information, such as the survey instrument, are also provided here.
